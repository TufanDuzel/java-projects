-- Word Counter -- 

The purpose of this program is to count the number of words in a string entered by the user. It prompts the user to input a paragraph, trims any leading or trailing spaces, and then checks for patterns of spaces between words to determine how many words are present. If the input is empty, the word count is set to zero. Otherwise, it starts by counting the first word and then uses a loop to find and count additional words based on the spaces in the input. Finally, the program outputs the total number of words in the given input.
