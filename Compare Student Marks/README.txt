- Compare Student Marks -

This project is focused on practicing object-oriented programming concepts in Java, specifically using the Comparable interface to compare custom objects. It involves creating a Student class that stores each student's name, subjects, and marks. The project includes methods to add subjects and marks to each student and calculates the total marks. By implementing the compareTo method from the Comparable interface, the project enables comparisons between students based on their total marks, determining which student has a higher score. This exercise helps reinforce understanding of constructors, data encapsulation, and interface implementation in Java.
