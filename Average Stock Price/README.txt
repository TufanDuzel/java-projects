- Average Stock Price Project -

This Java project is about creating a stock management system that allows tracking the buying and selling of stocks.
It includes a Stock class to manage the stock transactions, updating the share capital, and calculating the average price of the stock based on transactions.
The program can record transactions, update the number of shares, and compute the current price and average price per share.
