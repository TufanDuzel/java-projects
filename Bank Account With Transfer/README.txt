- Bank Account With Transfer -

This project is a simple Java-based simulation of a bank account management system. It includes a BankAccount class, which allows users to perform fundamental banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, and transferring amounts between accounts. Each BankAccount object has a balance and an account holder's name.

The project practices object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation (with private fields for account data), constructors, and method creation for each banking operation. Additionally, it offers practice in handling conditional logic within methods, especially for ensuring funds availability during withdrawals and transfers. This basic setup serves as a practical introduction to OOP and financial transaction handling in Java.
