- Roster Table -

This Java program is designed to create a roster table that tracks the assignment of individuals to specific days. It uses a nested ArrayList structure, where each day is represented by an ArrayList containing the names of people assigned to that day. The program allows the user to input names for each day and then retrieve the days a specific person is assigned to. By looping through the roster, it checks the presence of a person on each day and prints the corresponding day numbers when the person is found. This is useful for managing schedules or shifts across multiple days.
