- Student Selection -

This project is designed to create a program that helps select students eligible for a vaccine based on their age. The program allows the user to enter the total number of students, and then input each student's name and age. It uses arrays to store this data. The program then processes the input to identify and list students who are above 15 years old, determining who among them is eligible to receive the vaccine. This application can be particularly useful in schools or clinics to manage and streamline vaccination processes.
