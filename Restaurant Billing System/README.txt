- Restaurant Billing System -

This project is a simple restaurant billing system in Java. It uses the Bill class to record food orders, quantities, and calculates the total cost of the bill. Each order consists of a food item, its quantity, and price, which are stored using ArrayList structures. The project allows the addition of multiple items to the bill and calculates the total amount based on the items ordered.

This project provides practice with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, specifically focusing on managing collections with ArrayList, iterating through arrays, and calculating totals. It is a practical exercise in handling and organizing data in a real-world context, useful for building basic inventory and billing systems.
