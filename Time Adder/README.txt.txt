- Time Adder -

This project is a "Time Adder" program written in Java. The main purpose of the program is to take the current time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) from the user and add a specified amount of time (hours, minutes, and seconds) to it. The program then calculates the new time, taking into account any overflow (for example, if the seconds exceed 60, an additional minute is added). If the resulting time moves into the next day, the program indicates this as well. This project effectively demonstrates how to handle time calculations and manage overflow in a straightforward and logical way.
