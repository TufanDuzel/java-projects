- Budget Allocation -

This project is designed to create a budgeting system that allows the user to input their total available spending amount and
the proportions of this budget allocated to various expenses. The program ensures that the cumulative proportion does not exceed 100%
If the user inputs proportions that exceed the limit, the program adjusts the last entry to maintain a 100% total.
It then calculates and displays the actual spending amounts for each expense based on the user's input proportions.
