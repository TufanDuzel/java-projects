- Draw Staircases -

This project involves creating a Java program to generate a visual representation of a staircase. The program asks the user for the number of steps and the width of each step.
Using nested loops, it then prints a staircase where each step consists of asterisks (*). The number of asterisks increases with each step, creating a staircase pattern.
This project demonstrates the use of basic Java programming concepts, including loops and input handling with the Scanner class.
