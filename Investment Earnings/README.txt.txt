- Investment Earnings -

This project involves a Java program designed to track and calculate investment earnings or losses based on the buying price and subsequent closing prices of a share. Users can enter the purchase price per share and then continuously enter the closing price for subsequent days. The program calculates and displays the cumulative earnings or losses after each day. If a user enters a negative closing price, the program exits, signifying an end to the tracking process. This application is useful for investors to monitor their stock performance over time in a simple and effective manner.
