- Matrix Multiplication -

This project demonstrates matrix multiplication in Java, focusing on multiplying two 2-dimensional arrays (matrices). The program checks if the dimensions of the matrices are compatible for multiplication before proceeding. If the matrices are compatible, it uses a 3-level nested for loop to calculate each element of the resulting matrix.

The project provides practice with multidimensional arrays, nested loops, and matrix operations. It is a useful exercise for understanding matrix multiplication logic and implementing it programmatically, which is foundational in areas such as linear algebra, computer graphics, and scientific computing.
